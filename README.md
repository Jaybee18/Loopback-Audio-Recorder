# Loopback-Audio-Recorder
Tool for recording desktop audio

Uses loopback to record the output audio from the current audio output device. Saved recordings
can directly be copied to the clipboard to paste into a DAW or the filesystem or they can be
dragged from the application to wherever you want.
